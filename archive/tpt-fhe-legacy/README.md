# TPT/FHE Legacy Code Archive

This folder contains the original FHE-based TPT (Tradeable Private Token) implementation.

**Status:** Archived - Not part of current Brens Protocol focus

**Current Focus:** StealthPoolHook - Privacy without cryptographic complexity

The Brens Protocol has evolved from FHE-based encrypted tokens to a simpler, production-ready approach using vanilla Solidity and Uniswap v4 hooks. This archive preserves the original FHE work for reference.

See main README.md for current implementation.
